XR could possibly enhance the experince it could be very intutive.
We can play around through the controllers and hand gestures  as well.
The real world remains black white and the screen is coloured too create a distintion and contrast  between real and interface.

It will be interesting  to work on Desktop screen for now, I see having a discussion of in XR or replying to thread on slack in relation to be work envioroment will elevate the experience.



 Week 2 

Setting up -  The main is ( Concept ) 

Architectural material sourcing today is still heavily reliant on manual, physical, and fragmented processes. Architects must physically visit showrooms, collect swatches, and rely on printed catalogs or limited digital tools to compare materials. Material samples are often stored on-site, taking up space and requiring complex tracking. Decisions based on static samples can result in misjudgments, especially when light or context isn’t accounted for. Collaboration between architects, clients, and suppliers happens via emails, PDFs, meetings, introducing communication gaps and delays. Updates on material availability from suppliers are often manual or slow, leading to outdated decisions.The process lacks real-time visualization, resulting in misalignment, post-construction surprises, and inefficiencies in documentation.

Solution 

XR-enhanced application experience that transforms the material selection workflow into an immersive, collaborative, and data-driven process. XR-Powered Material Exploration
Users can explore, apply, and instantly compare materials inside a virtual environment — with realistic textures, lighting effects, and context-sensitive rendering.

Shared XR Collaboration
Clients, architects, and suppliers can join the same space remotely to view materials in real time, interact with environments, and approve selections together.

Drag-and-Drop Material Matching
Materials can be placed directly onto virtual 3D models — architects can instantly see how finishes look on actual project elements.

Environmental Simulation Tools
Users can modify lighting (time of day, interior spotlighting, etc.) to test how materials perform under real-world conditions.

Live Supplier Integration
The system links to supplier inventories in real time, ensuring up-to-date access to fabric options, trends, and availability.

Auto-Generated Documentation
As users finalize materials, the system creates spec sheets and procurement documents instantly — minimizing manual paperwork.

XR Front-End on Existing Apps (e.g., Odoo)
The XR experience is layered over existing systems like Odoo, connecting immersive interactions to the back-end architecture workflow (project data, documents, approvals).


Prototye - 

I am testing what features users need when they test out the product in XR. What details they look for when they buy products in reallife so i can immitate similar details on XR experience.
Methodology - I am using Paper Prototype and read aloud methods. I am trying to collect information by kniwung what indformation do they need when they are lookinfg for any new materials for their dream house
I have prototyped the sample and materials screen for thius testing. The screen shows the m sample from the supplier and the user is selectiong or choosing the materials in XR. They can see the details of materials like price colours variations in real time in 3d model of their future house istead of traditional way of going at different stores.

The architect clicks on oodoo app for CRM platform. It clics on projecrts and on going, Wgere  he connects the supplier on the same platform. Then he selects the product like tiles. They selects the room/ model  or chosses the sample model. Now using VR they can see the qoutes of different materaials just by interaction in space
