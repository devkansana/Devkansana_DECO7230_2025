XR could possibly enhance the experince it could be very intutive.
We can play around through the controllers and hand gestures  as well.
The real world remains black white and the screen is coloured too create a distintion and contrast  between real and interface.

It will be interesting  to work on Desktop screen for now, I see having a discussion of in XR or replying to thread on slack in relation to be work envioroment will elevate the experience.
