XR could possibly enhance the experince it could be very intutive.
We can play around through the controllers and hand gestures  as well.
The real world remains black white and the screen is coloured too create a distintion and contrast  between real and interface.

It will be interesting  to work on Desktop screen for now, I see having a discussion of in XR or replying to thread on slack in relation to be work envioroment will elevate the experience.



 Week 2 

Setting up -  The main is ( Concept ) 

Architectural material sourcing today is still heavily reliant on manual, physical, and fragmented processes. Architects must physically visit showrooms, collect swatches, and rely on printed catalogs or limited digital tools to compare materials. Material samples are often stored on-site, taking up space and requiring complex tracking. Decisions based on static samples can result in misjudgments, especially when light or context isn’t accounted for. Collaboration between architects, clients, and suppliers happens via emails, PDFs, meetings, introducing communication gaps and delays. Updates on material availability from suppliers are often manual or slow, leading to outdated decisions.The process lacks real-time visualization, resulting in misalignment, post-construction surprises, and inefficiencies in documentation.

Solution 

XR-enhanced application experience that transforms the material selection workflow into an immersive, collaborative, and data-driven process. XR-Powered Material Exploration
Users can explore, apply, and instantly compare materials inside a virtual environment — with realistic textures, lighting effects, and context-sensitive rendering.

Shared XR Collaboration
Clients, architects, and suppliers can join the same space remotely to view materials in real time, interact with environments, and approve selections together.

Drag-and-Drop Material Matching
Materials can be placed directly onto virtual 3D models — architects can instantly see how finishes look on actual project elements.

Environmental Simulation Tools
Users can modify lighting (time of day, interior spotlighting, etc.) to test how materials perform under real-world conditions.

Live Supplier Integration
The system links to supplier inventories in real time, ensuring up-to-date access to fabric options, trends, and availability.

Auto-Generated Documentation
As users finalize materials, the system creates spec sheets and procurement documents instantly — minimizing manual paperwork.

XR Front-End on Existing Apps (e.g., Odoo)
The XR experience is layered over existing systems like Odoo, connecting immersive interactions to the back-end architecture workflow (project data, documents, approvals).


Prototype - 

I am testing what features users need when they try out the product in XR, focusing on the kind of details they usually look for when buying products in real life. My aim is to replicate those same details in the XR experience so it feels natural and useful.

Methodology – I am using a paper prototype and the Read-Aloud method. This helps me collect insights about what information people need when searching for new materials for their dream house.

For this test, I have prototyped a “Sample and Materials” screen. This screen shows material samples from a supplier, and the user can select or choose these materials in XR. They can view details like price, colour variations, and texture in real time on a 3D model of their future house — instead of visiting different physical stores.

The workflow also connects with the Odoo CRM platform. For example, the architect logs into Odoo, goes to “Projects” and selects an ongoing project. They can then connect with a supplier on the same platform, select a product such as tiles, and assign it to a specific room or model. In VR, they can instantly see quotes and compare materials simply by interacting in the virtual space.
