## Week 1

### Introduction to XR and Project Scope

This week marks the beginning of the project, focusing on understanding the potential of **Extended Reality (XR)** in enhancing user experiences within the architectural workflow[web:1].

- Outlined the initial goals for integrating XR into material selection and collaboration processes[web:1].
- Discussed the importance of intuitive interactions using controllers and hand gestures[web:1].
- Explored methods to visually distinguish digital interfaces from the real environment through color and contrast[web:1].

### Initial Research and Ideation

- Researched current challenges in architectural material sourcing, including:
  - Manual showroom visits
  - Reliance on physical samples and printed catalogs
  - Fragmented communication between architects, suppliers, and clients[web:1]
- Brainstormed XR solutions that could address these pain points, such as real-time visualization, collaborative environments, and seamless integration with existing tools[web:1].

### Reflection

Starting work on the desktop allowed the definition of core user flows and set the foundation for future XR prototyping[web:1]. Early discussions highlighted the need for immersive collaboration tools and the potential impact of bringing communication platforms like Slack into the XR environment[web:1].
