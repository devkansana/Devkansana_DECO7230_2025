## Week 2

### Concept Development

This week focused on defining the main concept for integrating XR into architectural material sourcing. The traditional process remains heavily manual—requiring physical showroom visits, handling swatches, relying on print catalogs, and dealing with fragmented workflows. Communication between architects, clients, and suppliers is often delayed due to reliance on emails and in-person meetings. Real-time visualization is lacking, which can lead to misjudgments, outdated decisions, inefficiencies, and surprises during construction.

### Proposed XR Solution

- **Immersive Material Exploration:** Allow users to select, apply, and compare materials in a realistic virtual environment, including detailed textures and lighting effects.
- **Shared Collaboration:** Enable remote real-time collaboration between architects, clients, and suppliers within the same virtual space.
- **Drag-and-Drop Features:** Directly match and preview materials on 3D project models.
- **Environmental Simulations:** Modify settings like time of day or lighting to see true-to-life material performance.
- **Live Supplier Integration:** Access real-time inventory, trends, and up-to-date supplier information directly in the environment.
- **Automated Documentation:** Instantly generate specification sheets and procurement documents as materials are finalized.
- **XR Front-End Integration:** Layer the immersive XR interface over existing systems such as Odoo to streamline workflow and maintain data continuity.

### Initial Prototyping

- Designed a "Sample and Materials" screen as a paper prototype, enabling users to explore supplier offerings and view real-time details—such as price, color variants, and texture—on a 3D model.
- Connected the prototype workflow with Odoo CRM, allowing an architect to log in, select an ongoing project, contact suppliers, and assign products to specific project components within the XR space
