# Project Theme

My proposal focuses on transforming how architectural offices explore and select material samples through an Extended Reality (XR) experience.

### Identify the Application

Oddo is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform widely adopted in the construction industry for the management of project timelines, team communication, and supplier onboarding procedures. While the supplier onboarding feature remains nascent, its potential to facilitate material exploration among stakeholders is promising. Effective communication with architects and builders regarding materials procurement presents enduring challenges; the process of physically delivering samples and coordinating their collection is notably labor-intensive. Lean construction methodology, as outlined in contemporary research, supports the identification, reduction, and optimization of such processes to enhance operational efficiency.

Presently, the Australian construction industry is confronting three critical challenges, as identified by the Construction Industry Capability Team (CICT): a lack of workforce diversity, particularly with female representation below 12% and less than 2% of on-site roles being filled by women; difficulties in talent attraction and retention; and an ageing workforce with more than 40% expected to retire within 15 years. These factors collectively constrain the industry's capacity to deliver projects and foster sustainable growth.

This project seeks to investigate strategies for attracting new entrants, especially youth, to the construction sector and for enriching pedagogical approaches to industry education. Oddo’s online interactive modules, allowing for detailed material exploration (including sectional views), may serve as valuable tools for engaging designers and facilitating collaborative initiatives, such as during the AMW 2025 event. Additionally, Oddo could function as an educational resource in schools, enabling students to experience the material library interactively and fostering curiosity—ultimately helping to inspire and uplift girls’ participation in skilled trades.

### Task Identification

The current task on the platform involves:  
- Manually collecting materials at the office  
- Adding them to the task sheet on Odoo  
- Onboarding clients and builders  
- Scheduling appointments  
- Presenting materials across platforms  
- Updating builders and contractors  
- Returning materials to suppliers [1]  

My focus is on exploring Mixed Reality, which enhances spatial recognition in material exploration and visualization.  

**Tasks**:  

1. Virtual Assembly and Disassembly

   Users can virtually build or dismantle construction components using various materials within an XR environment. This task helps them understand how structural/Materials parts fit together/ integration of materails, identify potential complexity in assembly, and learn the sequence of construction steps interactively. 
   This supports designers and trainees in visualizing real-world construction processes without physical constraints.


2. Sectional Study of Material
   This interaction allows users to explore sectional views of materials in XR, revealing internal structures, composition layers, and performance characteristics. 
   Users can manipulate the material sections to gain deeper insight into how each layer contributes to the material’s functionality, aiding informed decision-making and educating apprentices on material science fundamentals.

3. Project Documentation and Coordination Task in XR
   The users enters the oddo dashboard in MR. They view the notification of delayed documentation. 


   The Project Documentation and Coordination task in Mixed Reality begins with the user entering a virtual workspace using an MR headset, where they can access project files and team contacts.
   When a problem arises, such as a delay in material delivery, the user receives a notification alerting them to the issue. They then review relevant project documents and schedules to understand the current situation.
   Next, the user communicates the problem to the team or suppliers using voice commands or hand controls within the MR environment. Afterward, they update the project schedule to reflect the delay using simple, interactive tools like drag-and-drop timelines. Once the changes are saved, the user sends confirmation messages to relevant team members. Finally, the user exits the MR workspace, having practiced effective documentation, communication, and coordination skills in a realistic virtual setting.

### Affordance in My Design Concept

In my concept, users can interact with materials much like they do in the real world by pointing, choosing, dragging, zooming, and handling them as if they were physical objects.  

- Architects could use proxemic maps (see figure 1) to explore room layouts.  
- Clients could view and compare materials in context via dashboards.  

**Assumptions**:  
- Hand-based interaction offers a natural, gesture-based interface for grabbing, moving, and inspecting virtual materials.  
- It recreates a tangible feel, despite objects being virtual.  
- Testing should explore user scaling preferences, hand vs controller interaction, and expectations for multi‑user collaboration (avatars or otherwise).

### Design Visuals

To better understand the design, I explored how the experience should look and feel. Based on Week 2 studio activities, I worked on storyboarding for Task 1: *Virtual Material Exploration and Comparison* (see figure 2).

---

### Assumptions

1. Users will primarily use hand gestures for interacting with virtual objects.  
2. Users will use a controller for navigating or interacting with on‑screen elements.  
3. Users expect the ability to view materials side‑by‑side for comparison.

### Engagement with Ideation Process

- **Scenario 2** (see figure 5)  
- **Scenario 3** (see figure 6)  
- **Figma Exploration** (see figure 7)

### Initial Testing Plan – Rapid Prototype

**Objectives**  
1. Test virtual material exploration and comparison tasks.  
2. Understand how users interact with materials (point, drag, zoom, rotate).  

**Methodology**  
1. Type: Rapid prototyping with low-fidelity mockups  
2. Approach: Think‑Aloud  
3. Participants: Shawn and Cimi  
4. Prototype: Paper sketches + cardboard models + basic visuals  

**Data to Collect**  
- Qualitative: User comments, observed pain points, confusion moments (Think Aloud + observation notes).  

**Script**  
1. Explain objective (<1 min)  
2. Task 1 – Select a virtual material and inspect it  
3. Task 2 – Compare it with another material using the dashboard  
4. Task 3 – Place the material in a virtual room  
5. Wrap-up – Ask for feedback, suggestions, and biggest frustrations

### Results

1. Both users naturally used their hands to explore the virtual object.  
   - Shows hand-based interaction feels intuitive and matches expectations.  
2. When asked to scale the object, users looked for an on‑screen option.  
   - Indicates some confusion; users expect scaling controls in the interface rather than gestures alone.  
3. Some users asked if they needed a larger physical room for the model to work.  
   - Suggests concerns about spatial requirements for MR and highlights the need for optimization across different room sizes. (see figures 7–9)

There are lot of problems in materials places on sites with unskilled labours so that cost materials in expesive issues and safety hazards. 

In particular, prevention through design (PtD) integrates safety aspects from the early design stage of projects [5]
The lean construction methodology encourages process identification, reduction, and optimization [6].

Virtual reality (VR) enables the creation of an interactive environment for cognitive learning where users can examine virtual but realistic site environments, identify hazards, and perceive the direct consequences of their actions without exposing themselves to the risks of reality


In addition, inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and handouts and low interest in reading safety manuals contribute to accidents.
