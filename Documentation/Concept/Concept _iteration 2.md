Odoo-Enabled Construction Education Platform for Workforce Diversity

---

## Problem Context

The Australian construction industry faces a critical confluence of challenges that threaten its long-term sustainability and growth capacity. **Female representation remains significantly below 12% across the industry, with less than 2% of on-site roles filled by women**, while simultaneously confronting an **aging workforce crisis with over 40% expected to retire within the next 15 years**. These demographic constraints, coupled with persistent difficulties in **talent attraction and retention**, collectively limit the industry's ability to deliver projects and foster sustainable development.[sydneybuildexpo+5](https://www.sydneybuildexpo.com/women-in-construction-resource-library/8-women-construction-statistic-australia-updated-2024)

Parallel to these workforce challenges, the industry grapples with operational inefficiencies that lean construction methodology seeks to address. Traditional material procurement processes, particularly the **labor-intensive coordination of physical sample delivery and collection between suppliers, architects, and builders**, represent significant waste in the construction value chain. These inefficiencies not only increase project costs but also create barriers to effective stakeholder collaboration and material exploration.[ube+1](https://www.ube.ac.uk/whats-happening/articles/what-is-lean-construction/)



## Tech Foundation

Odoo, a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform, has gained **widespread adoption in the construction industry** for managing project timelines, team communication, and supplier onboarding procedures. The platform's existing infrastructure supports three critical touchpoints: suppliers uploading material specifications, builders managing project schedules, and emerging supplier onboarding capabilities that hold **promising potential for facilitating material exploration among industry stakeholders**.[odooexpress+2](https://www.odooexpress.com/industries/construction)youtube

While Odoo's supplier onboarding feature remains in its nascent stages, its digital architecture provides an ideal foundation for addressing both operational inefficiencies and educational engagement challenges simultaneously.[odoo-bs](https://www.odoo-bs.com/real-estate-construction)



## Educational Intervention Opportunity

This project investigates how **Odoo's interactive material exploration capabilities can serve dual purposes**: streamlining industry operations while functioning as an educational gateway to attract new entrants, particularly youth and underrepresented groups, to construction sectors. The platform's potential extends beyond professional applications to serve as an **innovative educational resource in schools**, enabling students to experience material libraries interactively and fostering curiosity about construction careers.[burgerconsulting+1](https://burgerconsulting.com/building-a-diverse-future-embracing-inclusion-in-the-construction-industry/)

The integration of this technology-enabled educational approach aligns with events such as **Australian Manufacturing Week (AMW) 2025**, where **collaborative initiatives and educational outreach programs** demonstrate industry innovation to diverse audiences. By leveraging Odoo's online interactive modules, the platform can facilitate detailed material exploration experiences that bridge the gap between theoretical classroom learning and practical industry application.[ieomsociety+4](http://ieomsociety.org/ieom2017/papers/183.pdf)



## Research Objectives

This study seeks to develop and validate a framework that transforms **Odoo's existing construction management capabilities into an educational tool using XR **designed to inspire and attract diverse talent to the industry. The research specifically aims to address workforce diversity challenges by creating engaging, technology-mediated experiences that **help inspire and uplift girls' participation in skilled trades** while simultaneously optimizing material exploration processes for existing industry professionals.

Through this dual-purpose approach, the project contributes to both immediate operational improvements via lean construction waste reduction and long-term industry sustainability through enhanced educational engagement and diversity initiatives.[digitalcommons.fiu+1](https://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=succeed)



## User Groups

The XR experiences are designed for three primary user groups:

- **High School Students (Ages 16â€“18):** Students (particularly female students) exploring construction careers

- **Construction Professionals:** Builders, architects, and suppliers interested in streamlined  modules that simulate real-world workflows, support sustainable material exploration 

  

### Task Identification

------

#### Task 1: Virtual Assembly and Disassembly

Users engage in **virtual construction component assembly and disassembly** within an XR environment, utilizing various materials to understand structural integration and assembly complexity. This interaction enables participants to learn construction sequences interactively, supporting both designers and trainees in visualizing real-world processes without physical constraints.

#### Task 2: Sectional Study of Materials

This XR interaction allows users to explore **detailed sectional views of construction materials**, revealing internal structures, composition layers, and performance characteristics. Users manipulate material sections to gain deeper insights into how each layer contributes to overall functionality, supporting informed decision-making and educating participants on **fundamental material principles**.

This task directly addresses the identified challenge of **material exploration accessibility**, providing immersive alternatives to traditional physical sampling processes while enhancing educational value through interactive visualization.

#### Task 3: Project Documentation and Coordination

The final task integrates **Odoo dashboard functionality within a Mixed Reality environment**, simulating real-world project management scenarios. Users enter the virtual workspace through MR headsets, accessing project files, team contacts, and notification systems that mirror professional construction management workflows.

The scenario begins with users receiving **delay notifications for material delivery**, requiring them to review project documents, communicate with team members through voice commands or hand controls, and update project schedules using **interactive drag-and-drop timelines**. This task develops critical **documentation, communication, and coordination skills** within a realistic virtual setting, bridging educational simulation with professional practice requirements.
