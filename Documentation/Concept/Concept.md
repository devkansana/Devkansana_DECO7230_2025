# Project Theme

My proposal focuses on transforming how architectural offices explore and select material samples through an Extended Reality (XR) experience.

---

### Identify the Application

Odoo is an open-source platform that helps architecture offices manage projects, materials, clients, and suppliers in one place, on both desktop and mobile applications.  

Material sourcing is slow and inefficient due to manual sample collection, limited visualization, poor communication, and outdated catalogs. Adding XR to Odoo could let architects preview materials in real spaces digitally, speeding decisions, reducing errors, and improving workflow.

---

### Task Identification

The current task on the platform involves:  
- Manually collecting materials at the office  
- Adding them to the task sheet on Odoo  
- Onboarding clients and builders  
- Scheduling appointments  
- Presenting materials across platforms  
- Updating builders and contractors  
- Returning materials to suppliers [1]  

My focus is on exploring Mixed Reality, which enhances spatial recognition in material exploration and visualization.  

**Tasks**:  
1. Virtual Material Exploration and Comparison  
2. Real-Time Collaborative Material Selection  
3. Automate specification and documentation generation

### Affordance in My Design Concept

In my concept, users can interact with materials much like they do in the real world by pointing, choosing, dragging, zooming, and handling them as if they were physical objects.  

- Architects could use proxemic maps (see figure 1) to explore room layouts.  
- Clients could view and compare materials in context via dashboards.  

**Assumptions**:  
- Hand-based interaction offers a natural, gesture-based interface for grabbing, moving, and inspecting virtual materials.  
- It recreates a tangible feel, despite objects being virtual.  
- Testing should explore user scaling preferences, hand vs controller interaction, and expectations for multi‑user collaboration (avatars or otherwise).

### Design Visuals

To better understand the design, I explored how the experience should look and feel. Based on Week 2 studio activities, I worked on storyboarding for Task 1: *Virtual Material Exploration and Comparison* (see figure 2).

---

### Assumptions

1. Users will primarily use hand gestures for interacting with virtual objects.  
2. Users will use a controller for navigating or interacting with on‑screen elements.  
3. Users expect the ability to view materials side‑by‑side for comparison.

### Engagement with Ideation Process

- **Scenario 1** (see figure 4)  
- **Scenario 2** (see figure 5)  
- **Scenario 3** (see figure 6)  
- **Figma Exploration** (see figure 7)

### Initial Testing Plan – Rapid Prototype

**Objectives**  
1. Test virtual material exploration and comparison tasks.  
2. Understand how users interact with materials (point, drag, zoom, rotate).  

**Methodology**  
1. Type: Rapid prototyping with low-fidelity mockups  
2. Approach: Think‑Aloud  
3. Participants: Shawn and Cimi  
4. Prototype: Paper sketches + cardboard models + basic visuals  

**Data to Collect**  
- Qualitative: User comments, observed pain points, confusion moments (Think Aloud + observation notes).  

**Script**  
1. Explain objective (<1 min)  
2. Task 1 – Select a virtual material and inspect it  
3. Task 2 – Compare it with another material using the dashboard  
4. Task 3 – Place the material in a virtual room  
5. Wrap-up – Ask for feedback, suggestions, and biggest frustrations  

---

### Results

1. Both users naturally used their hands to explore the virtual object.  
   - Shows hand-based interaction feels intuitive and matches expectations.  
2. When asked to scale the object, users looked for an on‑screen option.  
   - Indicates some confusion; users expect scaling controls in the interface rather than gestures alone.  
3. Some users asked if they needed a larger physical room for the model to work.  
   - Suggests concerns about spatial requirements for MR and highlights the need for optimization across different room sizes. (see figures 7–9)

There are lot of problems in materials places on sites with unskilled labours so that cost materials in expesive issues and safety hazards. 

In particular, prevention through design (PtD) integrates safety aspects from the early design stage of projects [5]
The lean construction methodology encourages process identification, reduction, and optimization [6].

Virtual reality (VR) enables the creation of an interactive environment for cognitive learning where users can examine virtual but realistic site environments, identify hazards, and perceive the direct consequences of their actions without exposing themselves to the risks of reality


In addition, inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and handouts and low interest in reading safety manuals contribute to accidents.
